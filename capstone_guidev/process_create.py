# TODO

# intending to use this file to contain function that will create c++ backend processes for organization purposes
# main file will serve to contain mainly tkinter code

# c/c++ style file inclusion is not possible so everything that directly interacts with the gui needs to be in the main file since that is where root is declared
# file inclusion in python works like modules, very similar to verilog
